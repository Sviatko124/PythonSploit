# PythonSploit
Pythonsploit is a C2 framework created for use in CTFs and other safe environments. This tool helps easily manage compromised hosts from a single terminal window. 

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sviatko124/PythonSploit
cd PythonSploit
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x psconsole.py
./psconsole.py
```


## Usage
The PythonSploit console has a `help` menu which lists all commands you can use. 
If you don't want to use the automatically generated payloads from the `gen` command, you can try creating your own reverse shell, but be aware that it might not work. 

# DISCLAIMER
